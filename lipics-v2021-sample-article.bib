  abstract      = {We study interactive proofs with sublinear-time verifiers. These proof systems can be used to ensure approximate correctness for the results of computations delegated to an untrusted server. Following the literature on property testing, we seek proof systems where with high probability the verifier accepts every input in the language, and rejects every input that is far from the language. The verifier's query complexity (and computation complexity), as well as the communication, should all be sublinear. We call such a proof system an Interactive Proof of Proximity (IPP). On the positive side, our main result is that all languages in NC have Interactive Proofs of Proximity with roughly \surd{}n query and communication and complexities, and polylog(n) communication rounds. This is achieved by identifying a natural language, membership in an affine subspace (for a structured class of subspaces), that is complete for constructing interactive proofs of proximity, and providing efficient protocols for it. In building an IPP for this complete language, we show a tradeoff between the query and communication complexity and the number of rounds. For example, we give a 2-round protocol with roughly n3/4 queries and communication. On the negative side, we show that there exist natural languages in NC1, for which the sum of queries and communication in any constant-round interactive proof of proximity must be polynomially related to n. In particular, for any 2-round protocol, the sum of queries and communication must be at least ~\ensuremath{\Omega}(\surd{}n). Finally, we construct much better IPPs for specific functions, such as bipartiteness on random or well-mixing graphs, and the majority function. The query complexities of these protocols are provably better (by exponential or polynomial factors) than what is possible in the standard property testing model, i.e. without a prover.},

  abstract      = {This paper puts forward a new notion of a proof based on computational complexity and explores its implications for computation at large. Computationally sound proofs provide, in a novel and meaningful framework, answers to old and new questions in complexity theory. In particular, given a random oracle or a new complexity assumption, they enable us to prove that verifying is easier than deciding for all theorems; provide a quite effective way to prove membership in computationally hard languages (such as ${cal C}o$-$cal N cal P$-complete ones); and show that every computation possesses a short certificate vouching its correctness. Finally, if a special type of computationally sound proof exists, we show that Blum's notion of program checking can be meaningfully broadened so as to prove that $cal N cal P$-complete languages are checkable.},

  abstract      = {Recently, there has been significant work studying distribution testing under the Conditional Sampling model. In this model, a query specifies a subset S of the domain, and the output received is a sample drawn from the distribution conditioned on being in S. In this paper, we improve query complexity bounds for several classic distribution testing problems in this model.First, we prove that tolerant uniformity testing in the conditional sampling model can be solved using \~{O}(\ensuremath{\epsilon}-2) queries, which is optimal and improves upon the \~{O}(e-20)-query algorithm of Canonne et al. [CRS15]. This bound even holds under a restricted version of the conditional sampling model called the Pair Conditional Sampling model. Next, we prove that tolerant identity testing in the conditional sampling model can be solved in \~{O}(\ensuremath{\epsilon}-4) queries, which is the first known bound independent of the support size of the distribution for this problem. Next, we use our algorithm for tolerant uniformity testing to get an \~{O}(\ensuremath{\epsilon}-4)-query algorithm for monotonicity testing in the conditional sampling model, improving on the \~{O}(\ensuremath{\epsilon}-22)-query algorithm of Canonne [Can15]. Finally, we study (non-tolerant) identity testing under the pair conditional sampling model, and provide a tight bound of [EQUATION] for the query complexity, where the domain of the distribution has size N. This improves upon both the known upper and lower bounds in [CRS15].},

  abstract      = {Consider two problems about an unknown probability distribution p: (1) How many samples from p are required to test if p is supported on n elements or not? Specifically, given samples from p, determine whether it is supported on at most n elements, or it is ''\cyrchar\cyrie{}-far'' (in total variation distance) from being supported on n elements. (2) Given m samples from p, what is the largest lower bound on its support size that we can produce? The best known upper bound for problem (1) uses a general algorithm for learning the histogram of the distribution p, which requires \ensuremath{\Theta}(n/\cyrchar\cyrie{}2 logn) samples. We show that testing can be done more efficiently than learning the histogram, using only O(n/\cyrchar\cyrie{} logn log(1/\cyrchar\cyrie{})) samples, nearly matching the best known lower bound of \ensuremath{\Omega}(n/\cyrchar\cyrie{} logn). This algorithm also provides a better solution to problem (2), producing larger lower bounds on support size than what follows from previous work. The proof relies on an analysis of Chebyshev polynomial approximations outside the range where they are designed to be good approximations.},
